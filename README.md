## About Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks

If you're new to SRCNN, here's an abstract straight from the paper:

We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the
low/high-resolution images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods
can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes
all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical
on-line usage. We explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve trade-offs between performance and speed. Moreover, we extend
our network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.
